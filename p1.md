**Project I - IBM Model I (deadline 15 April)**

- Given a parallel corpus (provided by assistants).
- Implement IBM Model I and its EM training and apply that to train on the given corpus
- Implement the Viterbi alignment algorithm for maximum probability alignment for every sentence pairs and apply to the training corpus
- Extract the translation table from the Viterbi alignments
- Evaluate the alignment quality against the quality of the alignments provided by Giza++ (aligned by the assistants for your use). Report alignment precision and recall.
- Implement a simple improvement of your own choice over IBM Model I in terms of the alignments to reduce the effects of the assumptions made by IBM Model I
- Write and submit a PDF report max. 2 A4 in ACL article format with
    - Introduction
    - IBM Model I;
    - EM training formula;
    - Describe your own improvement over IBM Model I and
    - Experiments section with results.
    - Conclusions
